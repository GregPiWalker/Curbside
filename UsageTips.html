A new visit requires a patient name and a chief complaint. The current
date and time are automatically selected as the new visit's creation
timestamp, but you may back-date the visit by tapping on the date-time
field and selecting the desired value. Since all values on a visit log
except for the patient can be modified, you may fill in the remaining

immediately or later.</p>
      <p>As you type
in the patient name, comparisons are made against your existing patient
database. Partial matches are displayed in a list below the name field.
If the patient for whom you are logging a visit appears in the list,
simply select that row and the name will be filled in for you. If a
recognized patient name appears in the name field, a button which
allows you to view the patient record
will become visible to the right of the text box.</p>

      <p>There are
several ways to add a new patient. For convenience, a new patient
record is automatically created at the same time that a new visit is
logged, if the patient name given to the "New Visit" view does not
already exist in the patient database. This allows you to log a visit
rapidly without worrying about patient details until later. In this
case, the new patient is not actually saved until the new visit is also
saved. An interruption in creation of the new visit will prevent a new
patient record from being saved. Alternatively, new patients can be
created by pressing the "+" button in the upper right-hand corner of
the "My Patients" view.</p>
      <p>While
creating a new patient record, you may choose to add additional
information. Any number of allergies, current known medications, and
pharmacies may be added. Neither allergies nor medications are related
to prescriptions yet, but at some point I hope to associate them. This
will give the benefit of warnings when a prescription is given for a
known allergen, as well as a searchable list of medications.</p>
      <p>The new
patient will not be saved until the "Done" button is pressed. Pressing
"Cancel" instead will discard the new patient record.</p>

Contacts database. This feature is enabled by a hidden toolbar in both
the "New Patient" view and the "Edit Patient" view. Expose the toolbar
by first ensuring that the scrollable area is scrolled all the way to
the top, removing all fingers from the display, and then scrolling the
view down again. This will make the toolbar slide down below the
navigation bar. If the toolbar appears by accident, simply press the
"Cancel" button on its left side. To continue with the data import
operation, press the "-&gt;" button on its right side. This will open

      <p>Importing

log under that patient's name can be used to easily call the patient's
default pharmacy without dialing a phone number.</p>
      <p>There are two ways to dial a pharmacy. First, open an existing
visit in
the "Visit" view by selecting it from the "Visit Log" view.
Alternatively, you can view the visit by first viewing the patient,
scrolling down to the "Visits" section and then tapping on the desired
visit. Once you are in the "Visit" view, you should see a toolbar at
the bottom. Pressing the "Call It In" button on the right side will
summon the phone dialer and automatically dial the phone number saved
in the patient's default pharmacy.</p>
      <p>You can also dial a pharmacy while viewing an existing patient
in the
"Patient" view, so long as that patient has at least one pharmacy.
Scroll the view down to the bottom until you see the "Pharmacies"
section. Perform a long-press on the pharmacy you wish to call. A menu

      <p>A visit report contains all information pertinent to a

Patient information is kept to a minimum.
Visits reports can be compiled on demand and delivered via email. This
feature requires that you have
previously configured an email account on your device. Currently, you
can export an individual visit or the complete visit log for an
individual
patient. If you have provided your email address in the
Curbside settings, then the destination address for the report email
will be filled in automatically.</p>
      <p>To send a report on
a single visit, open an existing visit in the "Visit" view by selecting
it from the "Visit Log" view. Alternatively, you can open the visit by
first viewing the patient, scrolling down to the "Visits" section and

      <p>To send a report on

logs, there will be a toolbar present at the bottom of the view. Press
the "Report Visits" button on the left side of the bottom toolbar.</p>
      <p>Pressing
either of the report buttons will open the Apple Email app and
compose a new email message with a subject, message body and,
depending on the Curbside settings, a destination address. The report
is also attached to the email as an HTML file for convenience. You need

<p>As of version 1.2, you can import Curbside data that was saved as in
a backup archive.&nbsp; This is an effective means for ensuring that
all of your Apple devices are using the same Curbside data.&nbsp; When
you import saved data, only the data that does not yet exist will be
imported.&nbsp; This way new patients and visit records are imported
without altering pre-existing entries.&nbsp; You can keep two (or more)
devices in sync by backing up Curbside data from both devices and then
importing those data into the respective opposite device.&nbsp;
Importing saved data is also helpful if, for some reason, your Curbside
app was deleted or lost.&nbsp; In that case, you can simply download
Curbside again and import the previously backed-up data to restore your
app to normal.<br />
</p>
<p>To import saved data, you must use the Apple Mail app on the device
that will read the data.&nbsp; If you have emailed the data backup to
yourself, simple view that email message.&nbsp; Otherwise, copy the
Curbside backup file from the app's shared folder in iTunes, attach it
to an email message and send the message to yourself.&nbsp; Once the
email message is open, tap on the attached file.&nbsp; You will be
presented with a choice to open the file using Curbside.&nbsp; If you
select that option, Mail will close and Curbside will open with all of
the new data merged into your existing data.<br />
